            <h2>About Patrick</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            Patrick Rose moved to Sheffield in 2010 to study Computer Science,
            and discovered the folk scene there. After throwing himself blindly in
            to the Sheffield folk scene, he decided to record a couple of songs for
            posterity.
        </p>
        <p>
            During July 2011 he took the 30 Song A Day challenge going viral
            over Facebook and put his own spin on it â€“ not just taking the
            originals and linking to them, but also recording a cover using home
            equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
            After that, he worked on a creating a demo album,
            <a href="http://patrickrose.bandcamp.com/album/himself">Himself</a>, which
            was released in November 2011. The album contains self-penned songs,
            traditional tunes and was reviewed positively by Stirrings amongst
            others. He followed up in November 2012 with
            <a href="http://patrickrose.bandcamp.com/album/paradise-square">Paradise Square</a>,
            a selection of songs based on Sheffield.
        </p>
        <p>
            Patrick is interested in the traditional music of England and
            Ireland, not just for the music he enjoys singing and playing, but for
            the stories hidden behind the songs.

        <p>
            Patrick is a predominantly self taught singer. His style of singing is comfortable
            in any style of song, be it a powerful shanty in a session with friends or a softer
            ballad.
        </p>
        <p>
            Patrick can also offer singing lessons, or information on how to overcome nerves
            while singing. Please contact him for more information.

                <h2>Guitarist</h2>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Patrick started to learn guitar at a young age, but didn't take a full
            interest in the instrument until moving to Sheffield in 2010.
        </p>
        <p>
            During his time at university, he began to experiment with open tunings
            and work on his finger picking technique. Influenced by Martin Simpson,
            Sam Carter and Gavin Davenport, his arrangements focus on subtlety so the
            words can shine through.

                <h2>Caller</h2>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Patrick learned to call after a friend asked Whiskey For Six to run
            a ceilidh. His dance repertoire is varied, with both English and Irish
            dances and he has also written a few of his own.
        </p>
        <p>
            Patrick's repertoire of dances range from the simple to the complex -
            meaning he is capable of calling for beginners and for more advanced groups.
